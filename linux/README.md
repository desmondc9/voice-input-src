# VoiceInput (Linux)

Wayland-native voice input for KDE Plasma 6, sway, and hyprland. Hold a configured key, speak, release — the transcript is pasted into the focused application.

> Status: **Phase 6** — tray icon now reflects pipeline state (`media-record-symbolic` while dictating, `audio-input-microphone` idle), matching the macOS `mic`/`mic.fill` parity. Phase 5 features (Settings dialog, Enabled / Language / LLM Refinement submenus, unified default mode) remain. Headless `transcribe` CLI still works.

> **Phase 3 GNOME note**: the overlay uses `wlr-layer-shell`, which GNOME's mutter does NOT implement. `voice-input listen` will fail to position the capsule correctly on GNOME — explicitly out of scope.

## Build

Requires Rust 1.83+, `cmake`, `libclang`, and `cc`/`gcc`. On first build, whisper.cpp compiles from source (≈30–60 s).

```bash
cd linux
cargo build --release
```

System packages (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install cmake clang libclang-dev libasound2-dev`.

## Download a whisper model

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/voice-input/models
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/voice-input/models/ggml-small.bin \
  https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-small.bin
```

Sizes: `tiny` (75 MB), `base` (142 MB), `small` (466 MB, default), `medium` (1.5 GB). Override the path with `VOICE_INPUT_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model.bin` or by setting `whisper_model_path` in `~/.config/voice-input/config.toml`.

## Install ydotool (for `listen` mode only)

The listen mode pastes text by invoking `ydotool` to simulate Ctrl+V. This requires the `ydotoold` daemon to be running with `/dev/uinput` access. Bootstrap with the included script:

```bash
./scripts/install-ydotool.sh
```

The script installs the `ydotool` package, adds a udev rule, joins you to the `input` group, and enables a systemd user service for `ydotoold`. **Log out and log back in afterward** for group membership to take effect.

## Run

### Default mode (full app)

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
```

A tray icon appears in your system tray (KDE Plasma) or waybar (sway / hyprland — needs the `tray` module). The hotkey + overlay are wired automatically. The menu exposes:

- **Enabled** — master switch. Toggle off to silently ignore the hotkey without quitting.
- **Language ▶** — whisper transcription language (auto-detect / English / 中文 / 日本語 / 한국어 / Español).
- **LLM Refinement ▶** → **Enabled** + **Settings…** — opens the dialog for Base URL / API Key / Model with Test + Save.
- **Quit** — clean shutdown.

All menu changes persist to `~/.config/voice-input/config.toml` automatically; no manual file editing needed.

### Transcribe mode (Phase 1)

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- transcribe
```

> Use `--release`. Debug-profile whisper inference is 5–10× slower; you'll get poor results without it.

Reads from the default microphone, slices speech on natural pauses (≥300 ms silence), and prints each transcribed segment. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

Example output:
```text
[segment 1] 你好世界
[segment 2] this is a test
```

### Listen mode (Phase 2)

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- listen
```

First run: the XDG portal prompts you to bind a global shortcut. Recommended: **Right Ctrl** (single key, easy to hold, rarely conflicts).

Then: focus any text input, hold the configured key, speak, release. The transcript is pasted into the focused field. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the daemon.

Requires the steps in "Install ydotool" above.

### Overlay capsule (Phase 3)

When you hold the configured shortcut, a small dark capsule appears at the bottom-center of your screen with an animated 5-bar waveform that tracks your speaking volume. When you release, the capsule briefly shows "Refining…" then disappears as the text is pasted.

The tray icon switches to a red **record** glyph (`media-record-symbolic`) while audio is being captured, and reverts to the microphone glyph the moment you release the hotkey. The overlay capsule continues to show "Refining…" while the LLM is processing, so you can tell capture-vs-refinement apart at a glance.

Requires `wlr-layer-shell` support in your compositor:
- **KDE Plasma 6**: works (KWin 6+ supports it).
- **sway / hyprland**: works.
- **GNOME**: not supported — mutter does not implement layer-shell.

### LLM refinement (Phase 4)

Optionally pass the raw transcript through an OpenAI-compatible chat completion before pasting. The system prompt is intentionally conservative — it fixes ASR errors (`配森 → Python`, `杰森 → JSON`, etc.) but does NOT rewrite or polish the text. If the API is unreachable, paste falls back to the raw transcript.

Configure via `~/.config/voice-input/config.toml`:

~~~toml
llm_enabled = true
llm_api_base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
llm_api_key = "sk-..."
llm_model = "gpt-4o-mini"
~~~

The `llm_api_base_url` accepts any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp server, Together, Groq, etc.). The 10 s request timeout matches the macOS app. A future Settings UI (Phase 5) will replace manual TOML editing.

#### Ollama (local) example

For a fully-local setup, run [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and point voice-input at its OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

~~~bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:2b
ollama serve  # usually already running as a systemd user service
~~~

~~~toml
llm_enabled = true
llm_api_base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
llm_api_key = "ollama"
llm_model = "qwen3.5:2b"
llm_timeout_secs = 30  # optional; default 30. Bump higher for slow cold-starts on bigger models.
~~~

`llm_api_key` can be any non-empty string — Ollama does not validate it, but the refiner short-circuits when the key is empty. Small local models (≤3B) often follow the conservative system prompt loosely; if you see the model rewriting or paraphrasing rather than just fixing ASR errors, try a larger model (7B+) or use a cloud provider for refinement.

## Compositor support

- **KDE Plasma 6**: target compositor, built-in StatusNotifierItem host. Portal `GlobalShortcuts` works out of the box.
- **sway**: requires waybar with `tray` module. Portal support via `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` (less mature than KDE; document a compositor-binding fallback if portal proves unreliable).
- **hyprland**: requires waybar / ironbar / Riftbar with `tray` module. Portal support via `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`.
- **GNOME**: **not supported.** Mutter lacks `wlr-layer-shell` (needed in Phase 3).

## Config

`~/.config/voice-input/config.toml` — created on first run. Edit and restart to change. Notable keys:

- `language_hint = "zh"` — passed to whisper as a hint (`"en"`, `"ja"`, etc., or empty for auto-detect)
- `whisper_model_size = "small"` — determines the default model path
